This project was very challenging but also very fun! I really liked the idea of being able to scrape through a website and return information out of it. It took me sometime to make everything work but it worth it since you get trained in concepts that you are going to use in later projects. The most challenging part for me was to figure out how to connect the files together with the 'require' method. Thank you flatiron for these awesome lessons that you make!!
